** Sequence of Autoencoders to replace end-to-end Backpropagation **

This repository contains an idea for architecture and an algorithm to replace end-to-end Backpropagation. It uses a sequence of Autoencoders to achieve that. Please check out the diagram for more information. The code is run on the MNIST dataset. The highest accuracy achieved was 60%-70% with a relatively small number of training examples per class. 

Clustering is used to determine the nearest class to classify test data.
